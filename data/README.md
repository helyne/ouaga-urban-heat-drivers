## Raw Datasets

### Shapefile Ouaga/ (tracked in git)
- **What:** Ouagadougou city boundary polygon
- **Used by:** Nearly all notebooks (defines the Area of Interest)
- **Included in repo:** Yes — small enough to track directly

### osm-roads/
- **What:** OpenStreetMap road network extract for the Ouagadougou area
- **Source:** [Protomaps OSM Exports](https://app.protomaps.com/downloads/osm) — bounding box: `-1.795, 12.14, -1.265, 12.588`
- **License:** ODbL (Open Database License) — requires attribution to OpenStreetMap contributors
- **Used by:** `notebooks/road_water_distance_measures.ipynb`
- **Setup:** Download the shapefile export for the bounding box above and extract into `data/raw/osm-roads/`

### OCHA-HDX/
- **What:** Burkina Faso administrative boundaries (national, regional, commune levels)
- **Source:** [OCHA HDX - Burkina Faso Admin Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-bfa)
- **License:** Check dataset page for current license (typically CC-BY)
- **Used by:** `notebooks/ouagadougou-shp-tutorial.ipynb`
- **Setup:** Download and extract into `data/raw/OCHA-HDX/`

### dem_ouaga/
- **What:** Digital Elevation Model for Ouagadougou area (SRTM-derived)
- **Source:** Downloaded via `notebooks/DEM/download_preprocess_DEM.ipynb`
- **License:** Public domain (SRTM/NASA)
- **Used by:** `notebooks/DEM/download_preprocess_DEM.ipynb`
- **Setup:** Run the DEM notebook to download automatically

### GHS-SMOD-Copernicus/
- **What:** Global Human Settlement Model (urban/rural classification grid)
- **Source:** [Copernicus GHS-SMOD](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/download.php?ds=smod)
- **License:** Copernicus open data policy — free to use with attribution
- **Used by:** `notebooks/ouagadougou-shp-tutorial.ipynb` (exploratory only)
- **Setup:** Download tiles R8_C18 and R8_C19 for the 2025 epoch and extract into `data/raw/GHS-SMOD-Copernicus/`

### ndvi_ndbi_bsi/
- **What:** Pre-computed spectral indices (NDVI, NDBI, BSI) from Sentinel-2, 30m resolution
- **Source:** Generated by `notebooks/NDVI_NDBI_BSI/NDVI_NDBI_BSI_Sentinel2_updated.ipynb`
- **License:** Derived from Copernicus Sentinel-2 data (open)
- **Used by:** Reference/cache only — the main pipeline recomputes these from GEE
- **Setup:** Run the NDVI/NDBI/BSI notebook, or skip (not required for the main pipeline)

## Processed Data

The `processed/` directory contains pipeline outputs (aligned raster stacks, individual band GeoTIFFs). These are generated by the processing pipeline and should not be edited manually.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo (you'll get the AOI shapefile automatically)
2. Download the OSM roads extract (see above) if working with distance features
3. Download OCHA-HDX boundaries if working with the shapefile tutorial
4. Other datasets are either downloaded by notebooks or fetched from Google Earth Engine
