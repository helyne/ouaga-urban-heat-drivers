    "Many of our variables come from **satellite** and other **earth observation sources**. Before we can do any modeling, we need to acquire this data and preprocess it. This includes, amongst other things:\n",
    "- cleaning the data (e.g removing outliers and bad quality images or filtering for specific time periods), \n",
    "- reprojecting data to the same coordinate system/resolution/timestep for comparability, \n",
    "- and often times doing a little numerical magic to ensure our model is mathematically sound (like converting Kelvin to Celsius, computing NDBI from different bands, scaling, averaging, normalizing, or balancing unbalanced features)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A little tool tip\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we can use **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** with Python (in our Jupyter Notebooks) to download and analyze data. Despite the hurdle of having to learn some Python programming, there are several benefits to using GEE for accessing and processing our satellite data:\n",
    "- it's free (for research and non-commercial use)\n",
    "- it offers many modern earth observation products from different official agencies (e.g. Copernicus, NASA)\n",
    "- a ton of data preprocessing is already done for us\n",
    "- and it has built-in solutions to process/transform images *in the cloud*, meaning we don't have to use our personal computing resources to download and process data\n",

    "    - In the top right of the pop-up, click → **“New project”**.\n",
    "2. Name the new project & copy the ID:\n",
    "    - Give it a name (e.g. `Ouaga Hot Spots`) (and optionally change the Project ID)\n",
    "    - Note down the **Project ID** (a short string like `ouaga-hot-spots`).\n",
